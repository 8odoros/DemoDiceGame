Ideas

Row 1: Vp and (TODO) End game cards (set collection, Vps from gems not used)
Row 2: Engine building cards

1. Instant Victory Point Cards
   (Spend gems → Get VP now, no strings attached)

   "Lucky Strike" (Cost: 2 red + 2 blue) → 3 VP

   "Gem Hoard" (Cost: 1 of each color) → 4 VP

   "Masterpiece" (Cost: 3 purple) → 5 VP

2. Dice Manipulation Cards
   (Modify rerolls or dice results)

   "Loaded Dice" (Cost: 2 green) → Reroll up to 3 dice, but you must keep the new results.

   "Gem Magnet" (Cost: 1 blue + 1 red) → Choose a color, all players must give you 1 gem of that color (if they have it).

   "Wild Surge" (Cost: 3 any color) → Treat one die as any gem color this turn.

3. Player Interaction (Attack/Defense)
   (Disrupt opponents without long-term effects)

"Gem Theft" (Cost: 2 purple) → Steal 1 gem of your choice from another player.

"Dice Scramble" (Cost: 1 red + 1 green) → Force one opponent to reroll all their remaining dice.

"Shielded Vault" (Cost: 2 blue) → Block the next gem theft targeting you.

4. Gem Conversion & Economy
   (Flexible spending options)

"Alchemist" (Cost: 2 any color) → Trade 2 gems for 1 gem of any other color.

"Gem Overflow" (Cost: 4 any color) → Discard 4 gems, draw 2 new cards (from the buy row).

"Prismatic Trade" (Cost: 1 purple) → Swap 1 gem with the bank for another color.

5. Risk vs. Reward Cards
   (Push-your-luck effects)

"Double or Nothing" (Cost: 1 red) → Roll 1 die:

Gem face: Gain 2 gems of that color.

Blank face: Lose 1 gem (your choice).

"Gem Rush" (Cost: 0) → Roll 3 dice, take 1 gem per match… but skip your next turn.

6. Endgame Boosters
   (Big plays for final rounds)

"Last Gamble" (Cost: 5 any color) → Roll all 8 dice, gain 1 VP per gem rolled.

"Final Offer" (Cost: ALL your gems) → Gain VP = 2x the number of gems spent.
